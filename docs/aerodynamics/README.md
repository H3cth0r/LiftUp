# Aerodynamics
Aerodynamics is the study of the dynamics of gases, or the interaction between a moving
object and atmosphere causing an airflow around the body.

### The three basic forces
- lift
- drag
- sideforce

#### Drag
Amount of drag on aircraft is made up of many drag force with three main:
- Parasite drag: Combination of different drag forces. Any exposed object on aircraft offers
		some resistance to the air, and the more objects in the airstream, the more
		parasite drag. It also includes the drag caused by the material surface.
- Profile drag: may be considered the parasite drag of the airfoil. The various components
		of parasite drag are all of the same nature as profile drag. 
- Induced drag: action of the airfoil that gives lift, also causes drag

Since fluid always move from high pressure toward low pressure, there is a spanwise movement of air
from the bottom of the wing outward from the fuselage and upward around the wing tip.
This flow of air results in "spillage" over the wing tip, thereby setting up whirlpool of air
called **vortex**.

### The three basic moments
- Pith (y axis)
- Roll (x axis)
- Yaw  (z axis)

### The three basic components
- Wing
- Fuselage
- Tail

### Wings || Airfoils
- Role is to generate lift
- Lift is perpendicular fo incoming flow
- Surface designed to obtain desirable reaction from the air through which it moves.
- Any part of the aircraft which converts aier resistance into a force useful
		for flight is an airfoil.

#### Shape of airfoil
The shape of a wing consequently affects the efficiency of the wing.

Resulting properties are determined by the action of each section along the span.

Efficiency of awing it measures in terms of the **lift over drag (L/D) ratio**. This ratio vaires
with the angle of attack but reacher a definite maximun value for a particular angle of attact.
At this angle, the wing has reached its max afficiency. Shape of the airfoil determines the angle
of attact at which the wing is most efficient. It also determnes de degree of efficiency. 
It's been shown that the most efficient airfoild for general use have the mac thickness occurring
about one-third of the way back from the leading edge of the wing.

Amount of lift produced by airfoil will increase with an increase in wing chamber. Chamber refers
to the curvature of an airfoil above and below the chord line surface.

#### Bernoullis principle
An increase in the speed of the fliud accours simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or
a decrease in the fluid's potential energy. Equivalent to the principle of conservation
of energy. In steady flow the sum of all forms of mechanical energy in a fluid along a streamline
is the same at all points on that streamline.

$$ {P_Above \over P_Below} = {V_Below \over V_Above} $$

### Atmosphere and basic aerodynamics
- Air ir made up of approximately 21% oxygen(O2) and 78% Nytrogen(N) with reamining of 1% being
	made up from other gases.
- The ratos of the gases vary little with height, although the moisture content drops with
	increase in altitude.
- The understanding of basic aerodynamics - the possibility of flight, forces acting
	on aircraft in flight.
- Physically atmosphere is considered as a fluid of chaning density, pressure and temperature.
- As altitude increases, up to 30,000 feet(10 000 m), the temperature, pressure and density of
	the air decrease == TROPOSPHERE and the upper boundary == TROPOPAUSE.
- Being the minimal temperature (about -60°) at tropopause, it rises to - 10° at stratopause,
	which is much higher.
